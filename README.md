# Meganote

A simple note-taking app that saves notes in HTML and plain text and
supports multiple users.

Based on the curriculum for [Xtern Bootcamp 2016](https://github.com/xternbootcamp16).

## Technical Overview

* [AngularJS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/)
* [UIRouter](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

In development:
* [ECMAScript 2016 (ES6)](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - development dependencies
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - build system
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - compile ES5 to ES6

## Getting Started

>Meganote uses NPM to manage development dependencies, so install node if necessary.

To get started, clone the repository, and run `npm start`.

```shell
git clone <this repository>
cd <this project folder>
npm start
```

This will start a web sever on port 8000.

## Deployment

To deploy Meganote, copy the `app` folder, including `bower_components` subfolder (which is not included in the repository) to your remote server.
